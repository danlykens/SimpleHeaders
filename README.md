# SimpleHeaders
An Altium Library of Simple PCB Headers

# V1
I got tired of searching for parts if I needed a stupid simple header for a design in Altium, so I made a library with a bunch of them.
The initial release of this library is single spaced, 2.54mm pin headers for PCB designs. There are Altium parts for 1 through 50 positions. If I get annoyed and need more than that or diferent pitches, I'll add more in the future.
